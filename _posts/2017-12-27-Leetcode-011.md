Container With Most Water
-------------------
The origianl question is as follow.

Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.






Misunderstood question
------

At first I misunderstood the meaning of the question. I wonder there are many line, and if we pull as much as water into the lines, what will happen.

In order to solve this misunderstood question, I use some method. Such as set a Dynamic Programme Matrix, from the two side reach to the highest line. And change the True or False situation.

Then I use some recursive function. The code is as follows.

```
class Solution(object):
    def maxArea(self, height):
        """
        :type height: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """ 
        highest = 0
        flag = 0
        for i in range(len(height)):
            if height[i] > highest:
                highest = height[i]
                flag = i
        print flag
        print highest
        if flag == 0:
            pass
        else:
            for i in range(flag-1):
                if height[i+1] < height[i]:
                    height[i+1] = height[i]
        if flag == len(height):
            pass
        else:
            for i in range(len(height)-1,flag+1,-1):
                print i
                if height[i] > height[i-1]:
                    height[i-1] = height[i]
        area = 0
        for i in range(flag):
            area = area + height[i]
        print flag
        print len(height)
        for i in range(len(height)-1,flag,-1):
            area = area + height[i]
        return area
```



My First Method
------------
Calculate all the situation. Time consuming is N square and Space consuming is 1.



Fisrt Python code
-------------
```
class Solution(object):
    def maxArea(self, height):
        """
        :type height: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """ 
        area = 0
        for i in range(len(height)-1):
            for j in range(i+1,len(height)):
                area = max(area, min(height[i],height[j])*(j-i))
        return area
```


My Second Method
----------
Use two nodes, initially is the maximum range. Which node the value is smaller, change to inside one. Until reach together.

```
class Solution(object):
    def maxArea(self, height):
        """
        :type height: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """ 
        start = 0
        end = len(height) - 1
        area = 0
        while start != end:
            area = max(area,(end-start)*min(height[end],height[start]))
            if height[start] < height[end]: start += 1
            else: end -= 1
        return area

```
