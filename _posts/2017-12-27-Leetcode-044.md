Wildcard Matching
-----
Implement wildcard pattern matching with support for '?' and '*'.

**Example:**

```
'?' Matches any single character.
'*' Matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence).

The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

The function prototype should be:
bool isMatch(const char *s, const char *p)

Some examples:
isMatch("aa","a") → false
isMatch("aa","aa") → true
isMatch("aaa","aa") → false
isMatch("aa", "*") → true
isMatch("aa", "a*") → true
isMatch("ab", "?*") → true
isMatch("aab", "c*a*b") → false
```



My Solution
-----
Use the Dynamic Programme. Use the same method as "010. Regular Expression Matching". Use the new matrix `dp[i][j]`. Its value equals to the matching situation of first __i__ items in __s__ and first __j__ items in __p__.

Firstly we set all the value in __dp__ as __False__. If the matching situation is acceptable, change situation from __False__ to __True__. And finally we need the __dp[len(s)][len(p)]__.

The next step of Dynamic Programme is we need to find the recursive function. We can set the rules as follows.

```
If the i equals to 0, if p[j-1] equals to "*", then next p[j] will have the same status as p[j-1].
```

```
If the i in range 1 to len(s), there are several situations.
1. If s[i-1] == p[j-1] or p[j-1] is ".", the True status will delivery to lower right conrner.
2. If p[j-1] is "*", the True status will delivery to bottom of it, and all the right of the bottom one.
3. Otherwise the True status will not delivery.
```

With this two kinds of rules, we can give the final solution.




Python code

```
class Solution(object):
    def isMatch(self, s, p):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type p: str
        :rtype: bool
        """

        dp = [[False for _ in range(len(p)+1)] for _ in range(len(s)+1)]
        dp[0][0] = True
        if len(s) == 0 and len(p) == 1 and p[0] == "*": return True
        for j in range(1,len(p)+1):
            if p[j - 1] == '*':
                dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 1]  
        for j in range(1,len(p)+1):
            for i in range(1,len(s)+1):
                if p[j-1] == "*":
                    dp[i][j] = ((dp[i-1][j-1] or dp[i-1][j]) and i > 0) or dp[i][j-1]
                elif p[j-1] == s[i-1] or p[j-1] == "?":
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] and i > 0
                
        return dp[len(s)][len(p)]
```
