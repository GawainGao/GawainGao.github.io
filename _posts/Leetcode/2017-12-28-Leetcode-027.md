Remove Element
------------

Given an array and a value, remove all instances of that value in-place and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

**Example:**

		Given nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3,

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.





Method
----------
Put two node, when node 1 meet value, remove node 2 to finid the first one which is not the value. Change the position of them.

Pay attention we need the length of the output.



Solution
------------

```
class Solution(object):
    def removeElement(self, nums, val):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type val: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        p1 = p2 = 0
        flag = 0
        while p1 < len(nums):
            if nums[p1] == val:
                p2 = p1 + 1
                while True:
                    if p2 == len(nums):
                        return p1
                    elif nums[p2] == val:
                        p2 += 1
                    else:
                        nums[p1] = nums[p2]
                        nums[p2] = val
                        p1 += 1
            else:
                p1 += 1   
```
